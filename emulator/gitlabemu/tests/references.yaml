  # when !reference is used inside a list, if the address is a list
  # gitlab actually creates a list element that contains the list, eg:
  # script:
  #   - uname -a
  #   - - date
  #     - df -h
  #   - pwd > pwd.txt
  #
  # You can see this if you use the "View merged YAML" tab in ci/editor
  #
  # wierdly, this is seemingly legal to have a multi-dimensional list for scripts
